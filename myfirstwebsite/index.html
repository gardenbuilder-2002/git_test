    <h2>January 8th, 2024</h2>

    <p>Yesterday I bought a thing of peanut butter... and i ate pretty 
    much the <strong>whole</strong>  thing haaha. And that's not all,I 
    would say that the past 2-3 days have been off days. I felt low energy 
    and I thohhhhhhught I should eat more and that combined with a weird 
    eating restricition the my mind is prone to.</p>

    <p>However, it is the monday of a new week and today is a new day. 
    I will improve my behavior and habits and try to inspect how I can do better. 2024
    <em>isn't over yet</em>.</p>

    <h3>P.S.</h3>

    <p> I love you myself and dont forget "<em>its not that serious</em>"</p>
